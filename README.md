Create the following components, all within your app.js file.

<App>
Should contain all child components, which are wrapped in <React.Fragment>. The breakdown of child components is as follows. We will be expanding on this structure throughout the week:

<App>
  <Header>
  <Main>
    <Search>
    <Map>
    <Result>
<Header>

Should contain an <h1> with the title of your application (City Explorer).
Should contain a <p> with the following text: “Enter a location below to learn about the weather, events, restaurants, movies filmed there, and more!”

#<Main>:

Should contain the homepage markup and subsequent components. This includes the following:

    -A search box and button for searching for a location

    -A Google Maps placeholder

    -5 result boxes that will be used to house results our future API calls. You may use “lorem ipsum” text for now. Those APIs include: the Dark Sky API, Yelp API, Eventbrite API, MovieDB API, nd the Hiking Project API.

    - Use the current deployed site or your previous City Explorer front end code as a way to capture what features should exist. All dynamic data should be filled with placeholder content for now. We’ll update this later in the week with real-time data from 3rd party APIs.

#<Search>:

Should contain an <input> and a <button> element for searching for a location. This does not have to be wired to work yet - just the markup is required.

#<Map>:

Should contain a Google Map placholder. This does not have to be wired up work yet - just the markup is required.

#<Result>:

Should contain an <section> element with placeholder content that will be filled with real-time data later in the week. You may simply nest 5 <Result> components inside of <Main> for the time being. We will be recomposing this later in the week.
